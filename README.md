# Junior Developer Interview Prep

*Repository of things to assist Jr. developers with Interview Prep*

## Be Prepared to Whiteboard
You'll probably be given the opportunity to whiteboard a problem. The goal of this whiteboard session is not to see you write **perfect** code. Instead, it is designed to let a prospective employer see how you work out a problem. You should practice a scenario with a friend where someone asks you to solve a problem. These sorts of questions are very similar to word problems from gradeschool math.

#### Examples
- Can you draw an ERD diagram for the following SQL tables...?
- Can you write a logical statement for...?
- Can you manipulate an array/object using iteration...?
- Can you create a diagram that explains the purpose of MVC?
- Can you outline how to create an HTML Form to POST to...?
- Can you create a class (or constructor) for the following object...?
- Can you create an HTML template to render the following data...?
