# Junior Developer Interview Prep

*Repository of things to assist Jr. developers with Interview Prep*

## Be Prepared to Whiteboard
You'll probably be given the opportunity to whiteboard a problem. The goal of this whiteboard session is not to see you write **perfect** code. Instead, it is designed to let a prospective employer see how you work out a problem. You should practice a scenario with a friend where someone asks you to solve a problem. These sorts of questions are very similar to word problems from gradeschool math.

#### Examples
- Can you draw an ERD diagram for the following SQL tables...?
- Can you write a logical statement for...?
- Can you manipulate an array/object using iteration...?
- Can you create a diagram that explains the purpose of MVC?
- Can you outline how to create an HTML Form to POST to...?
- Can you create a class (or constructor) for the following object...?
- Can you create an HTML template to render the following data...?

## Reseach the Company
If you're going to apply and then interview with a company, you should be familiar with what they sell/use. Research their Github; see what their developers use (if you can). If the company offers a service, create an account, login and try it out. Write down some questions about their product. Inspect their source code on the front end to see what libraries they may use. The more you know about the company when walking into the interview, the better!

#### Examples
- Github.com - In a `frameworks.js` file, they bundle/minify...
  - jQuery
  - Facebook for jQuery
  - Sizzle CSS Selector Engine
- GeneralAssemb.ly - uses...
  - jQuery
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Google Analytics

## Final Thoughts
- Before interviewing, think of a 3-5 questions you'd like to ask the interviewer about the company/their product/wht you'll be doing.
- Dress to impress... but ask what the expected dress code will be when scheduling the interview. Dress up one step nicer than that.
- Don't be afraid to say **I don't know**. It is better than lying. 
- If you need for clarification, ask! 
- Don't ask for specifics regarding benefits on the first interview.
- Ask what your role in the organization will be and what you can do to prepare for it prior to being hired.
- Get your interviewer's email address. Email them next day thanking them for their time. They'll remember you.
- Don't waste interview time with useless small talk.
- Talk to a friend before interviewing. You'll feel confident going in. It isn't a bad idea to walk to an interview with a friend.
